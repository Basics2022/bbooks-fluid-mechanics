:columns: 8

Two equal, parallel flat plates are separated by a distance $d$.  
A thin layer of liquid is present between the plates.  
The area of the surfaces $A$ and the perimeter $L$ of the plates are known,  
as well as the ambient pressure $p_a$, the surface tension of the liquid $\gamma$, and the contact angle $\theta$.  
The task is to determine the component of the force acting on each plate that is perpendicular to the plates.

**Concepts.** Surface tension. Contact angle.

**Solution.** The setup described in the exercise is an equilibrium condition.  
The force acting on a plate is due to two effects: surface tension at the fluid perimeter,  
and the pressure difference between the fluid and the ambient.  
We consider the force positive if it is attractive.

$$F = F_\gamma + F_p$$

-   Calculation of $F_\gamma$:

    $$F_\gamma = \gamma L \sin \theta$$

-   Calculation of $F_p$. The pressure jump is obtained by applying interfacial equilibrium:

    $$F_p = (p_a - p) A$$ 

    with:

    $$(p_a - p) d = 2 \gamma \cos \theta$$

-   The total requested component is thus:

    $$F = \frac{2 \gamma A \cos \theta}{d} + L \gamma \sin \theta$$
